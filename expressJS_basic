ExpressJS ---> framework of nodeJS

Useful in ---> 1. easy to create APIs
               2. helpful in request handling
               3. can get routes easily

Generally, Get() method is used for loading pages and other methods like put(),post(),fetch() and delete() is used while submitting a form, calling a API etc

The second parameter of above method is a function with two arguments ----> request and response (it is not important that both parameters will be used), which is used for interaction between server and client.

A client will always request and server will always response. NodeJS is a server.

Whenever a request will be arrived from client --> it will initialise request parameter and the response from server and data sent from the server will initialise the response parameter.
